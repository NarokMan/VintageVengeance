VINTAGE VENGEANCE DEMO

Our project is weird. We do not have a backend. 
As instructed, we have implemented a localstorage
to store the user's best time.

We have implemented 3 different phases:
- Main menu
- Game
- Win screen

When we implement the usage of JSON reading to 
store map data, the win screen will change to a 
'next level' screen or something similar.

TO RUN:
Run the index.html file as a server and it will run.
We have the website hosted at https://www.cs.nmt.edu/~arodriguez/

We have been using the 'Live Server' extension on Visual Studio Code.

Please ensure the files stay in their same relative
paths, as the game uses relative paths for the images.

The objective of the game is to get to the highlighted
parking spot ASAP. Drive the car by pressing the up,
left, and right arrow keys. Be sure to hit the
pedestrians. Try to get as low a time as possible!

TO PLAY:
Drive the car by pressing the up, 
left, down, and right arrow keys.
